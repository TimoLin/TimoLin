### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**TimoLin/TimoLin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on LES/FPV of Turbulent Spray Combustion.
- ğŸŒ± My research interest: `LES`, `Flamelet models`, `Spray combustion`, `Turbulent inlet condions`, `OpenFOAM`...
- ğŸ‘¯ I use daily: `Vim`, `Python`, `C++`, `Git` ...
